            Happy Birthday to the one person who somehow became my whole world without even trying,
            the one who makes my life brighter, louder, more confusing, and at the same time more meaningful.
            You are my favorite human, my comfort, my safe place, and yes, sometimes my biggest headache,
            but even on those days, you are still the person I choose again and again.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love how you can be sweet and annoying in the same moment, how you act strong but have the
            softest heart, and how you care so deeply even when you pretend you don’t.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since you came into my life, normal days feel special, bad days feel easier,
            and silence doesn’t feel empty anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for being patient with me, for understanding me when I struggle to explain my feelings,
            and for loving me even when I am not perfect.
        </p>

        <p>
            On your birthday, I wish you happiness, good health, peace in your heart,
            and success in everything you chase.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope life is kind to you, and when it isn’t, I hope you always remember that
            you are never alone because I am right here.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope I get to celebrate many more birthdays with you,
            teasing you, supporting you, and loving you in my own imperfect way.
        </p>
